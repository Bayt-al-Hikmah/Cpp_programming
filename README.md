Welcome to the **C++ Programming Lectures** repository by [Bayt-al-Hikmah](https://github.com/Bayt-al-Hikmah)! This collection of lecture notes is designed for beginners and intermediate learners aiming to master C++ programming fundamentals. Whether you're new to coding or refreshing your skills, these notes provide structured, step-by-step guidance through core concepts.

Bayt-al-Hikmah (House of Wisdom) is dedicated to preserving and disseminating knowledge, inspired by the historic intellectual center of the Islamic Golden Age. These lectures emphasize clear explanations, practical examples, and hands-on exercises to build a strong foundation in modern C++.

## Prerequisites

- Basic familiarity with computers and file management.
- No prior programming experience required (though helpful).
- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC via MinGW on Windows, or Clang on macOS/Linux) and an IDE like Visual Studio Code, Code::Blocks, or CLion.

### Setup Instructions

1. Install a C++ compiler:
    - **Windows**: Download MinGW from [mingw-w64.org](https://www.mingw-w64.org/downloads/).
    - **macOS**: Use Homebrew: `brew install gcc`.
    - **Linux**: `sudo apt update && sudo apt install g++` (Ubuntu/Debian).
2. Install an editor/IDE: VS Code with the C/C++ extension is recommended for beginners.
3. Test your setup: Compile and run a "Hello, World!" program (example in Lecture 1).

## Course Overview

This 6-lecture series covers essential C++ topics progressively. Each lecture includes:

- Theoretical explanations.
- Code examples and snippets.
- Exercises for practice.
- References for further reading.

|---|---|---|
|Lecture|Topic|Key Concepts Covered|
|Lecture 1|Variables and Input-Output|Variables, data types (int, float, char, etc.), user input/output with cin/cout.|
|Lecture 2|Control Flow|Logical/comparison operators, if-else, switch-case, for/while/do-while loops.|
|Lecture 3|Pointers and Data Structures|Pointers, dynamic memory allocation, dynamic arrays, vectors, structs, typedef.|
|Lecture 4|Functions and Header Files|Function creation, parameters, return types, header files, scope rules.|
|Lecture 5|Object-Oriented Programming|OOP principles, classes, objects, namespaces, error handling.|
|Lecture 6|Advanced Data Structures and Files|Data structures, file I/O, working with bitmap and WAV files.|

**Recommended Pace**: 1-2 lectures per week, with time for coding practice. Total estimated time: 20-30 hours.

## Practice and Projects

- **Exercises**: Each lecture ends with coding challenges. Solutions can be added in a separate `/exercises` folder.
- **Mini-Project Ideas**:
    - Lecture 3: Simple calculator app.
    - Lecture 5: Student grade management system using arrays.
    - Lecture 6: Dynamic list implementation with pointers.
- Resources: [cppreference.com](https://en.cppreference.com/w/) for docs, [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) for problems.
